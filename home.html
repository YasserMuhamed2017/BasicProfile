            <li>About me:</li>
            <p style="font-size: medium; margin-right: 20px;"> A junior software engineer who graduated from faculty of engineering, and I have solid skills in computer 
                science and how to build backend applications. I've been fortunate to work on various projects that have 
                deepened my understanding of both front-end and back-end development, as well as database management. I 
                worked on my problem-solving skills and I’m passionate for creating backend projects.
                I work as an instructor in iSchool in Demi Summer Program powered by Ministry of 
                Communications and Information Technology (MCIT). I was teaching students how to program 
                and helping them to make projects to test their skills on them and how to make 2D games using 
                Godot.Developed and delivered engaging lectures and hands-on labs.
                Guided students in projects, enhancing their practical skills.
                Evaluated student performance and provided constructive feedback.
                Mentored students through coding projects, promoting hands-on learning and real-world 
                application.
                Guided students in programming and help them how to think in programming.
                Guided students to create advanced games using Godot Game Engine for making games.
                One of my key projects involved creating a web application for showcasing movies, which 
                allowed me to apply my knowledge in a real-world context and further develop my skills in
                Python, JavaScript, SQL, and Jinja languages
                It’s a dynamic web application that allows users to search for movies using title.
                Designed a responsive user interface using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
                Built a robust back-end using Python language and Flask framework, with a database 
                managed through SQLite Database for multiple queries.
                The web app includes login for checking the correct data to login to the website and a 
                routing page for changing password in the database and the user can add his favorite 
                movie to database and publish them in a new page and it’s available for delete any movies 
                he wants.
                I created a web application using django framwork for showing wiki pages which are saved as 
                Markdown content. User can create new page, search for a page, and edit page content.
                The application contains different features to navigate between different routes.
                First, user can search about the wiki page which is saved as markdown content.
                And user can add a new page with title and description and save it as a new markdown file.
                User can edit the content of the existing page for new information he wants to enter.
                User can search for an exited page in the route path and if he enters a wrong page, it shows 
                him an error. And User can search for a random page from the existing pages which are 
                saved as entries.</p>
